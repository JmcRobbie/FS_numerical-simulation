# Hipparchus Mailing Lists

Hipparchus has two discussion mailing lists and one announce list
to which anybody can subscribe:

  * users@hipparchus.org
  * developers@hipparchus.org
  * announce@hipparchus.org

Questions related to the usage of Hipparchus should be posted to the
users list. The developers list is for questions and discussion related
to the development of Hipparchus. Please do not cross-post; developers
are also subscribed to the users list. The announce list is read-only
and devoted to announce important news (like new releases).

The archives of the lists are available at [https://lists.hipparchus.org/](https://lists.hipparchus.org/).
