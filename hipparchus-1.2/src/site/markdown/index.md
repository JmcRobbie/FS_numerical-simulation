## Hipparchus: a mathematics Library

Hipparchus is a library of lightweight, self-contained
 mathematics and statistics components addressing the most common
 problems not available in the Java programming language.

## Modularized

Hipparchus is a large library, so it has been split into several
modules. Users can select only the modules they need
and developers can update modules more easily and more
often than would be possible in a large monolithic library.

---

## Guiding principles

  * Real-world application use cases determine development priority.
  * This package emphasizes small, easily integrated components
     rather than large libraries with complex dependencies and
     configurations.
  * All algorithms are fully documented and follow generally
     accepted best practices.
  * In situations where multiple standard algorithms exist, a
     Strategy pattern is used to support multiple implementations.
  * Limited dependencies. No external dependencies beyond the
     core Java platform (at least Java 1.8 starting with version
     1.0 of the library).

## Fork
 
Hipparchus started as a fork of [Apache Commons Math](https://commons.apache.org/math/).
The fork was initiated by most of the main developers and a few contributors of
Apache Commons Math.

Version 1.0 of Hipparchus is therefore very similar to
Apache Commons Math 3.6.1 with some elements of the development version
that would ultimately lead to Apache Commons Math 4.0 which was not released
at fork time.

## 1.2 Release is out!

Hipparchus 1.2 is now available for download from the [Hipparchus download page](downloads.html) or on Maven central and its mirrors under the groupId **org.hipparchus**. Highlights in the 1.1 release are:

* new RealFieldElement implementations computing a tuple
* method to compute the orientation of a triplet of points in 2D
* bracketing helper methods in UnivariateSolverUtils for RealFieldUnivariateFunction
* getBRep method to PolyhedronsSet to extract a Boundary REPresentation in regular cases
