This file is used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a JIRA search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
SVN commits.

To generate the file RELEASE-NOTES.txt from this file:

mvn changes:announcement-generate -Prelease-notes [-Dchanges.version]

The <action> type attribute can be add,update,fix,remove.

<!-- NOTE:
The description attribute entries below are specially formatted 
so as to improve the layout of the generated text release notes.

The parsing process removes all line feeds, replacing them with a single space.
The Velocity template in src/changes/release-notes.vm has been enhanced to replace pairs of adjacent spaces
with a new-line in the release notes. (These spaces are ignored when displaying HTML).
If the output is not quite correct, check for invisible trailing spaces!

    <release version="1.2" date="2017-10-25" description="This is a maintenance release.">
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added new RealFieldElement implementations computing a tuple. This allow to perform the
        same computation on several values at once.  The getReal() value correspond to the
        first component of the tuple.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added a method to compute the orientation of a triplet of points in 2D.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="fix" issue="issues/25">
        Fixed an error in EmpiricalDistribution causing cumulative probabilities to be returned
        as NaN when some data bins are empty.  This was reported against Apache Commons Math as
        MATH-1431.
        Github: fixes #25.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" issue="issues/24">
        Added bracketing helper methods in UnivariateSolverUtils for RealFieldUnivariateFunction.
        Github: fixes #24.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added a getBRep method to PolyhedronsSet to extract a Boundary REPresentation in
        regular cases (unbounded PolyhedronsSet or PolyhedronsSet with holes in their
        boundary are not supported).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" issue="issues/23">
        Fixed NullPointerException when computing size of unbounded polygons sets.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" issue="issues/22" due-to="Christoph Dibak">
        Improved performance of getRow and setRow for Array2DRowRealMatrix and Array2DRowFieldMatrix.
        Github: fixes #22.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" issue="issues/21">
        Fixed polygons creation from lists of vertices (both in Euclidean and spherical geometry)
        when separate edges share the same hyperplane (line or circle) but with different
        orientations.
      </action>
