              Hipparchus 1.2 RELEASE NOTES

The Hipparchus team is pleased to announce the release of hipparchus-1.2

The Hipparchus library is a library of mathematical components. It started as a fork of Apache Commons Math.

This is a maintenance release.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o             Added new RealFieldElement implementations computing a tuple.
              This allow to perform the same computation on several values at once.
              The getReal() value correspond to the first component of the tuple.
o             Added a method to compute the orientation of a triplet of points in 2D.
o issues/24:  Added bracketing helper methods in UnivariateSolverUtils for RealFieldUnivariateFunction.
o             Added a getBRep method to PolyhedronsSet to extract a Boundary REPresentation in
              regular cases (unbounded PolyhedronsSet or PolyhedronsSet with holes in their
              boundary are not supported).

Fixed Bugs:
o issues/25:  Fixed an error in EmpiricalDistribution causing cumulative probabilities to be returned
              as NaN when some data bins are empty.
              This was reported against Apache Commons Math as MATH-1431.
o issues/23:  Fixed NullPointerException when computing size of unbounded polygons sets.
o issues/21:  Fixed polygons creation from lists of vertices (both in Euclidean and spherical geometry)
              when separate edges share the same hyperplane (line or circle) but with different
              orientations.

Changes:
o issues/22:  Improved performance of getRow and setRow for Array2DRowRealMatrix and Array2DRowFieldMatrix.
