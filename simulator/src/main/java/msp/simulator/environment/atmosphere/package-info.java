 * The package Atmosphere gathers the different classes
 * of the simulator responsible for building any instance 
 * of the atmosphere of a planet. This is especially necessary
 * for the Earth.
 * <p>
 * Each class provides tools and methods to deal with the
 * behavior of such object, e.g. the variation of the density
 * with the altitude, allow drag forces etc. and is useful to 
 * create the overall simulation environment.
